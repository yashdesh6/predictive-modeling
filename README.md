# Predictive Modeling and Classification with Regression and KNN
## This is the finished code from FQ24 Weekend Workshop 1: Intro to Machine Learning: From Theory to Hands-On
This project showcases Linear and Ridge Regression for predicting house prices and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying Iris flowers. It covers key concepts like train-test split, feature scaling, regularization, and model evaluation through visualization.
## Technlogies used
Python, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
## Features
- Linear and Ridge Regression: Predicts house prices from California Housing data.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Classifies Iris species with decision boundaries and confusion matrix evaluation.
